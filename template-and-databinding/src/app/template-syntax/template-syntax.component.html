<h1>Template Expression</h1>
<!-- A template expression produces a value. Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a
property of a binding target; the target might be an HTML element, a component, or a directive.
Javascript expressions that have side effects are prohibited
assignments (=, +=, -=, ...)
new
chaining expressions with ; or ,
increment and decrement operators (++ and --)
no support for bitwise operator | and &
-->

{{1+1}}

<!-- Expression Context is the component instance -->
<!-- the below properties refers to the context of TemplateSyntaxComponent -->
<p>{{title}}</p>
<span [hidden]="isUnchanged">Changed</span>

<!-- An expression may also refer to properties of the template's context such as a
  template input variable , for example let hero or #heroInput-->

<p *ngFor="let hero of heroesObj">
  {{hero.name}}
</p>

<!-- If template input variable and component variables share the same namespace
  template variable name takes precedence, followed by name in directives context and lastly
component member names, preventing the name collision -->
<!-- For the below example even though heroInput is assigned a value 'name' in TemplateSyntaxComponent
heroInput still refers to HTMLInputElement -->
<input #heroInput>{{heroInput}}

<!-- template statement -->
<h1>Template Statement</h1>
<!-- A template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target
  such as an element, component, or directive. -->
<!-- A template statement has a side effect. That's the whole point of an event.
  It's how you update application state from user action -->
{{hero}}
<button (click)="setHero1()">Set hero</button>

<!-- How ever following are not allowed
  new
  increment and decrement operators, ++ and --
  operator assignment, such as += and -=
  the bitwise operators | and &
  the template expression operators
   -->
<!-- Statements can only refer to what's in the statement context
  Template context names take precedence over component context names.
Template statements cannot refer to anything in global namespace -->
<p>hero - {{hero}}</p>
<div *ngFor="let hero of heroesObj">
  <button (click)="setHero2(hero)">{{hero.name}}</button>
</div>

<!-- binding syntax -->
<h2>one-way from data source to target</h2>
{{hero}}
<p [hidden]="show">show target</p>

<h2>One-way from view target to data source</h2>
<button (click)="clickButton()">clickButton</button>


<h2>Two way</h2>
<input [(ngModel)]="myName" />
<button (click)="printMyName()">Print my Name</button> {{myName}}

<!-- attribute binding
setting the properties of DOM elements, components, and directives.
-->

<!-- Binding targets -->
<!-- Target of binding property is something in the DOM -->
<img [src]="heroImageUrl" />
<!-- setting a property to a directive -->
<div [ngClass]="classes">[ngClass] binding to the classes property</div>
<!-- We can also pass data to a child component using target binding -->

<h2>One way In</h2>
<!-- People often describe property binding as one-way data binding because it flows a value in one direction,
from a component's data property into a target element property -->
<!-- 1.	Avoid side effects while using template expressions.
  	Stick to data properties
    Use methods that just returns values and do no more. -->

<!-- The template expression should evaluate to the type of value expected by the target property.
    Return a string if the target property expects a string -->
<!-- If you omit the brackets, Angular treats the string as a constant and
    initializes the target property with that string. It doesn't evaluate the string -->

<h3> Content security </h3>
<!-- Angular data binding is on alert for dangerous HTML.
It sanitizes the values before displaying them. It will not allow HTML with script
tags to leak into the browser, neither with interpolation nor property binding. -->
<span [innerHTML]="evilTitle"></span>

<h3> Attribute, class and style bindings </h3>

<h4> Attribute binding </h4>
<!-- Interpolation and property binding can only be done on properties.
For attribute binding use [attr.*]-->
<table>
  <tr>
    <!-- Sets colspan value to 2 -->
    <td [attr.colspan]="1+1">TD - TD</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TD1</td>
    <td>TD2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4> Class binding </h4>

<!-- binding to specific class name -->
<button [class.isActive]="isButtonClicked" on-click="toggleButton()">Active</button>
<!-- binding to a string of class names -->
<span [class]="myClasses">My dynamic classes</span>

<h4>Inline styles with style binding</h4>

<!-- style property name can be written with camelCase or dash-case -->
<!-- setting a style property -->
<span [style.color]="isButtonClicked?'green': 'yellow'">Style bind</span>
<!-- setting style property with unit extension -->
<span [style.fontSize.px]="isButtonClicked?16: 32">Style bind</span>

<h4> Event binding </h4>
<!-- Event binding syntax consists of a target event name within parentheses on the left of an equal sign,
and a quoted template statement on the right. -->
<button (click)="toggleButton()">Toggle Button</button>
<!-- click is the target event -->
<!-- Element events may be the more common targets, but Angular looks first to see if the
 name matches an event property of a known directive, -->
<button (myClick)="toggleButton=$event">Toggle Button 2</button>
<!-- In an event binding sets up an event handler for the target event -->
<!-- The shape of the event object is determiend by the type of the target event -->
<!-- If the target event is a native DOM, $event is the DOMEventObject -->
<input [value]="myString" (input)="myString = $event.target.value" /> {{myString}}

<!-- Custom Events with eventEmitter -->
<!-- Directives raise custom events with eventemitter -->
<!-- The directive creates an EventEmitter and exposes it as an property -->
<!-- use @Output to the eventEmitter created in the child component -->
<app-child-component (propogateRequestToParent)="receivedEvent($event)"></app-child-component>
{{valueEmitted}}


<h2> Two way data binding </h2>
<!-- [()] use banana in the box for 2 way data binding -->
<app-two-way-data-bind [(size)]="fontSizePx" (resizeBy)="fontSizePx = $event"></app-two-way-data-bind>
<div [style.font-size.px]="fontSizePx">Resizable Text</div>


<!-- Attribute directives listen to and modify the behavior of other
  HTML elements, attributes, properties and components -->

<!-- To add or remove many CSS classes at the same time , use ngClass -->
<button on-click="setClasses()">Click me!</button>
<div [ngClass]="currentClasses">
  ngClass
</div>

<!-- To set many inline styles at the same time, the NgStyle directive may be the better choice. -->
<button on-click="setStyles()">Set styles!</button>
<div [ngStyle]="currentStyles">
  ngStyle
</div>

<!-- Before using the ngModel directive in a two-way data binding,
you must import the FormsModule and add it to the NgModule's imports list -->
<input [(ngModel)]="myName" (ngModelChange)="changeDetected()">

<!-- detecting ngModel Change with ngModelChange-->
<!-- ngModelChange detects only change on elements value-->
<input [(ngModel)]="myName">

<h2> Structural directives </h2>
<!-- Dont forget asterisk infront of ngIf -->
<span *ngIf="false"> hello world </span>
<span *ngIf="true"> hello world </span>
<!-- when ngIf is set false for a component, angular removes the component and its descendants from the DOM -->
<!-- ngIf directive is often used to safe guard against null -->


<!-- ngFor is a repeater directive -->
<!-- the string assigned to ngFor is not a template expression, but its a micro syntax -->
<!-- Angular translates this instruction into a <ng-template> around the host element,
then uses this template repeatedly to create a new set of elements and bindings for each hero in the list. -->

<p *ngFor="let hero of heroes">{{hero}}</p>
<!-- In the above ngFor hero is called template input variable -->

<!-- ngFor with index -->
<!-- The index property of the NgFor directive context returns
the zero-based index of the item in each iteration. -->
<p *ngFor="let hero of heroes; let i = index">{{i+"    "+hero}}</p>

<!-- To avoid a churn of repitions use trackBy -->
<p *ngFor="let hero of heroesObj; trackBy: trackByHeroes">
  {{hero.id}} {{hero.name}}
</p>

<!-- NgSwitch is like the JavaScript switch statement.
It can display one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition.  -->
<!-- NgSwitch is actually a set of three, cooperating directives: NgSwitch, NgSwitchCase, and NgSwitchDefault -->
<div [ngSwitch]="myCase">
  <p *ngSwitchCase="1">condition 1</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="2">condition 2</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="3">condition 3</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="4">condition 4</p>
</div>

<!-- NgSwitchCase adds its element to the DOM when its bound value equals the switch value.
NgSwitchDefault adds its element to the DOM when there is no selected NgSwitchCase. -->


<div [ngSwitch]="myCase">
    <p *ngSwitchCase="1">condition 1</p>
    <p *ngSwitchCase="2">condition 2</p>
    <p *ngSwitchDefault>condition 4</p>
  </div>


<h2> Template reference variables</h2>
<!-- A template reference variable is often a reference to a DOM element within a template.
It can also be a reference to an Angular component or directive or a web component. -->
<!-- But a directive can change that behavior and set the value to something else, such as itself. -->
<input #phone placeholder="phone number">

<button (click)="callPhone(phone.value)">Call</button>
<!-- A template reference variable (#phone) is not the same as a template input variable (let hero) -->
<!-- The scope of a reference variable is the entire template.  -->
<!-- You can use the ref- prefix alternative to # -->
<input ref-phonenumber placeholder="phone number">

<!-- Remeber all components are directives -->

<!-- Input and Output -->
<app-input-output [hero]="heroObj" (propogateRequest)="heroObj = $event"></app-input-output>
{{heroObj.id}}


<!-- Template expression operators -->
<!-- The pipe operator ( | )
The result of an expression might require some transformation before you're ready to use it in a binding.  -->
<div>Title through uppercase pipe: {{'name' | uppercase}}</div>

<!-- You can chain expressions through multiple pipes: -->

<div>Title through uppercase pipe: {{'name' | uppercase | lowercase}}</div>

<!-- And you can also apply parameters to a pipe: -->
<div>Birthdate: {{dateObj| date:'longDate'}}</div>

<!-- The json pipe is particularly helpful for debugging bindings: -->
{{heroObj | json}}

<!-- The safe navigation operator ( ?. ) and null property paths -->
<!-- The Angular safe navigation operator (?.) is a fluent and convenient way to guard
against null and undefined values in property paths. -->
{{sampleObj?.value}}
<!-- It works perfectly with long property paths such as a?.b?.c?.d. -->

<!--No hero, no text -->
<div *ngIf="hero">
    The hero's name is {{hero!.name}}
</div>
<!-- When the Angular compiler turns your template into TypeScript code, it prevents TypeScript from reporting
that hero.name might be null or undefined. -->
